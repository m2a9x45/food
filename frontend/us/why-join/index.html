                <p>
                    Going to the shops to buy food is time consuming, you have to travel their, find what your looking for, wait in line to pay and travel home. 
                    And you always end up buying more than you need. (At least I do) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We allows you to skip the lines and order from the confort of you home. No more trying to remember if you need more milk.

                <p>
                    Other delivery solutions are inflexible and expensive. Having to choose a large delivery window takes up your day, or paying 4 different 
                    service charges makes the service unreasonably expensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we allow to the minute delivery and only have one flat delivery fee, so that our service is actually affordable.

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Where are we now</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                Currently we're only avaible in Edinburgh, and we only deliver from Morrisons. We've built out our service but 
                we're by no means done. We've still got lots of execting ideas. So far we've build everyhting needed to match 
                tradisional shopping delivery. What we're really looking forward to is building the future of shopping.

            <h2>What's next</h2>
            <p>
                We've got a lot planned and our ideas list is allways growing. We've got something we'd like to let you know about now. Adding more supermarkets to the site is a must and
                getting local busniess to sell though us, would be incrediable. These are just two of our short term goals to improve the site
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding all the UK supermarkets, means that you can get your faviourit products from the brands you trust. As for local and small busniess we belive in 
                building tools to help enrich people's lives. And we see this as an opertunity to offer a fairer and more open platform to allow business that might not have the skills
                or time to reach new customer online, contect them with then.
