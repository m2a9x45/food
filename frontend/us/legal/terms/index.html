          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            These terms are an agreement between you and InverDeliver, that layout how you are allowed to use the platform, what action we can take and how certains parts of our service will work. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By using InverDeliver you agree to the terms set out here, along with our privacy policy. This includes using our website, API or any other interface we may realise in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scottish Law applies and disputes will be settled by Scottish Courts. You can contact us via help@inverdeliver.com
          </p>

          <h2>Placing an order</h2>
          <p>
            When an order is placed through our platform weâ€™ll try our best to deliver it at the requested time but we offer a best try model to try and achieve this. That means we may not be able to deliver 
            your order on time but we will always try and get it to you as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost of the order displayed on the website may be higher or lower than the actual cost of the order that you may be charged. This is to account for deals and discounts in the shops we shop 
            from along with weight based items or price changes. We will either refund you or take an additional price adjusted payment to account for these events. The price adjusted payment may be taken 
            from any card youâ€™ve used with InverDeliver, but weâ€™ll always try the card that paid for the order first. In the event that this adjustment payment cannot be made, your account will be suspended 
            until a payment is possible. We will continue trying to collect this payment as well.
          </p>
          <p>We donâ€™t take any responsibility for the quality, taste, safety or enjoyment of the products delivered to you. It is solely your responsibility to ensure that the products delivered are safe
               and correct. Of course we will take every possible step to ensure weâ€™re delivering high quality products that are tasty, but sometimes mistakes will happen and in those cases the retailer
                is who you should contact, weâ€™ll be able to provide any necessary documentation required for this, such as proof of purchase.</p>
