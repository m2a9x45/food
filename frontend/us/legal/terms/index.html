                <h4>Our Terms üìú</h4>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>These terms are an agreement between you and InverDeliver, that layout how you are allowed to use the platform, what action we can take and how certain parts of our service will work.</p>
            <p>By using InverDeliver you agree to the terms set out here, along with our privacy policy. This includes using our website, API, or any other interface we may realise in the future.</p>
            <p>Scottish Law applies and disputes will be settled by Scottish Courts. You can contact us via help@inverdeliver.com</p>

            <h2>Placing An Order</h2>
            <p>
                When an order is placed through our platform, we‚Äôll try our best to deliver it at the requested time, but we offer a best try model to try and achieve this. 
                That means we may not be able to deliver your order on time, but we will always try and get it to you as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cost of the order displayed on the website may be higher or lower than the actual cost of the order that you may be charged. This is to account for deals and discounts in the 
                shops we shop from. Along with weight-based items or price changes. We will either refund you the difference between the cost of the order and what we‚Äôve charged you if we‚Äôve charged 
                you more than the cost of the items in store. Or take an additional price adjusted payment to account for these events. The price adjusted payment may be taken from any card you‚Äôve
                used with InverDeliver, but we‚Äôll always try the card that paid for the order first. If this adjustment payment cannot be made, your account will be suspended
                until a payment is possible. We will continue trying to collect this payment as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don‚Äôt take any responsibility for the quality, taste, safety, or enjoyment of the products delivered to you. It is solely your responsibility to ensure that the products delivered 
                are safe and correct. Of course, we will take every possible step to ensure we‚Äôre delivering high quality products that are tasty, but sometimes mistakes will happen and in those cases 
                the retailer is who you should contact, we‚Äôll be able to provide any necessary documentation required for this, such as proof of purchase.
            </p>

            <h2>Orders Containing Alcohol</h2>
            <p>
                You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and not cause InverDeliver to contravene any applicable laws. If you order alcohol products from a Retailer through the Services, 
                you agree that you are of legal drinking age for purchasing, possessing, and consuming alcohol. That the recipient will not be intoxicated when receiving delivery of such products, 
                and that alcohol has not been purchased with the intent to resell the alcohol or provide the alcohol to someone who is not of legal drinking age
            </p>
            <p>
                If your order contains any alcohol product(s) we'll check your ID when we deliver your order to ensure your over 18 years old. If you are not over 18 years old, we'll deliver the rest
                of your order but not the alcohol product(s), you will also not be refunded for this alcohol product(s).
            </p>
            <p>
                Types of ID that we'll except for verification include your Passport or Driving Licence (a provisional is fine). A biometric residency permit or a National ID card. We will not accept 
                young Scot cards or university ID cards along with other forms of non-official ID. 
            </p>

            <h2>Cancelling An Order</h2>
            <p>
                You can cancel your if your order status is either ‚ÄúAwaiting Payment‚Äù or ‚ÄúOrder Received‚Äù, once your order moves to the ‚ÄúShopping Now‚Äù stages we‚Äôll be unable to cancel the order.
                You can check your order status by heading to the orders page https://inverdeliver.com/orders. 
            </p>

            <h2>Unavailable Items</h2>
            <p>When shopping for your order, if we can‚Äôt find an item(s) for any reason we‚Äôll go ahead and refund you for that item(s).</p>

            <h2>Order Delivery</h2>
            <p>We‚Äôll try our best to delivery your order on time but sometimes this won‚Äôt be possible, in these cases we‚Äôll send you and email or text message with a new deliver time.</p>
            <p>
                If we can‚Äôt locate the delivery address, we‚Äôll send you a text message or email to let you know we‚Äôre having problems locating the address. If after a reasonable period of time we‚Äôre
                unable to complete the delivery, we‚Äôll let you know we‚Äôve cancelled your order. You won‚Äôt be eligible for a refund. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If we are able to locate the delivery address but can‚Äôt complete the delivery, we‚Äôll leave your order in a safe location and follow, if possible, any notes you‚Äôve left about the delivery. 
                We‚Äôll provide you with the information on where your order has been left.
            </p>

            <h2>Changing Theses Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. When InverDeliver does so, we‚Äôll post the most current version of the Terms on our website and, if a revision to the Terms is
                material, notify you of the new Terms. Changes to these terms will not apply retroactively. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should discontinue your use of the Services.
