        This is the page that stripe will redirect the rider to if they 
        Your user is redirected to the refresh_url in these cases:

        The link is expired (a few minutes went by since the link was created).
        The user already visited the URL (the user refreshed the page or clicked back or forward in the browser).
        Your platform can no longer access the account.
        The account has been rejected.

        Your refresh_url should trigger a method on your server to call Account Links again with the same parameters, and redirect the user to the Connect Onboarding flow to create a seamless experience.
